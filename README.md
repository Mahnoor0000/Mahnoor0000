# Hi, I'm Mahnoor 

I write code in **Python** and **C/C++**, explore datasets for fun, and love digging into the world of **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.  
When I’m not cleaning messy data or plotting graphs, I’m usually asleep, scrolling endlessly, or reading something random. XD

### What I Do
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Building ML basics (regression, classification, clustering)  
- Exploring how to turn code into real-world solutions
