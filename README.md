# Hey, I'm Mahnoor 

I write code in **Python** and **C/C++**, and I'm focusing on **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**. Right now, I'm also working with **Computer Vision** using **OpenCV**.  
When I'm not cleaning up datasets or building models, I'm probably working on a new project or just browsing random stuff. XD

### What I Do
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Transforming raw data into meaningful insights through visualizations.
- **Machine Learning**: Working on advanced ML techniques and real-world applications.
- **Computer Vision**: Developing computer vision applications with OpenCV.
